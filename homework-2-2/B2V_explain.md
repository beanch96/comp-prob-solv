## Overview
The plot shows the variation of the second virial coefficient, B2V, as a function of temperature for three different potentials: Hard-Sphere, Lennard-Jones, and Square-Well.

## Hard-Sphere Potential
- **Behavior:** The B2V values for the Hard-Sphere potential remains constant and positive across all temperatures
- **Explanation:** The Hard-Sphere potential considers only repulsive interactions with a fixed diameter, therefore it won't change with temperature. 

## Lennard-Jones Potential
- **Behavior:** The B2V for the Lennard-Jones potential starts around -1.5 m^3/mol at lower temperatures and increases toward postiive values with increasing temperature. 
- **Explanation:** The Lennard-Jones potential includes both attractive and repulsive regions. At low temperatures, the attractive forces dominate(negative B2V), but at high temperatures the repulsive forces dominate(positive B2V)

## Square-Well Potential
- **Behavior:** Similar to the Lennard-Jones potential, the B2V for the Square-Well potential is negative, but it starts at around -2 m^3/mol at low temperatures, but increases and surpasses the Lennard-Jones values as Temperature increase.
- **Explanation:** The Square-Well potential, similarly to Lennard-Jones has an attractive and repulsive region. However, it is not capturing a more realistic behavior like Lennard-Jones potential.

## Summary
- The **Hard-Sphere** potential only models repulsion-therefore is independent of Temperature
- The **Lennard-Jones** and **Square-Well** potentials include both repulsive and attractive regions-therefore there is temperature dependance, with a behaviour of increasing B2V as Temperature increases.
