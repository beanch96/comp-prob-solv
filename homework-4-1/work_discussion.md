# Work Discussion for an Isothermal vs Adiabatic expansion

## Overview
The plot shows the variation of the expansion of an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal and adiabatic expansion

## Isothermal
- **Behavior:** The Isothermal expansion plot shows that as it expands there is more work done on the surroundings compared to adiabatic expansion.
- **Explanation:** The isothermal curve lies below the adiabatic curve because there is an exchange of heat with the surroundings in order to maintain constant temperature 

## Adiabatic
- **Behavior:** The adiabatic expansion plot shows that as it expands there is less work done on the surroundings compared to an isothermal expansion. 
- **Explanation:** Because there is no heat exchange, as the gas expands, it cools down due to an increase in internal energy, resulting in less work done over the same expansion range.

## Summary
- The **Isothermal Expansion** of an ideal gas does more work on its surroundings. 
- The **Adiabatic Expansion** of an ideal gas does less work on its surroundings.
